## Radiofrequency pulses: simulating


+mr function

toppe function

sinc pulse example

SMS pulse example (w/ imaging results)


## Gradients: estimating peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)

Vendors measure PNS experimentally to determine threshold.

Siemens model

GE model


## Non-cartesian imaging example: 3D stack of spirals

stack of spirals, including fat saturation

simulate spectral profile of fat sat pulse
